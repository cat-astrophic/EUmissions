## Description

This is the repo for a paper on the efficacy of EU vehicular emissions standards for NOx (oxides of nitrogen) at reducing per capita levels of NOx emissions in European nations.

In addition to running the econometric models, the script creates choropleth maps for per capita levels of Nox emissions by nation.

This paper is currently under review at *Journal of Cleaner Production*.
